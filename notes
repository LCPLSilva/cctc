once u ssh onto the pivot u need to create a dynamic tunnel to get ur proxychains on the machine. 
once ur on capstone one with a dynamic tunnel open, run a bash ping sweep like i showed u and figure out all the devices communicating with our float. 
then just run nmap scans through proxychains on the internet host through your dynamic tunnel on each system. thats where i found the info below.

float IP of pivot : 10.50.20.84

10.1.1.30: 80, pivot for network fundamentals and programming sections

10.1.1.33: 21, 23, 80
"RIPv2 seems to be running on the 10.1.1.0/25 network, try to sniff out the traffic to find out what networks its advertising in its updates. what you find will be the IP address of the next environment pivot to access from INTERNET_HOST

10.1.1.11: 21,23

10.1.1.25: 21

10.1.1.90: no ports
10.1.1.125: no ports i thought port 125 was open?
10.1.1.126: no ports

there is a webservice running on the port that corresponds with the RFC that governs Private IPv4 addressing
there is a PCAP saved in the share folder of this machine that you should look at

10.1.1.25: 21
there is a webservice running on the port that corresponds with the RFC that governs IPv4 Header structure
There is another hint in the student home drive, there is no SSh access to this system so try using FTP with your student credentials

telnet to 10.1.1.33, then run tcpdump -i eth0 "port 520" -vv


so once i got on the .126 via iptable mangle rule and using port 7777, i realized it had access to the 10.2.2.6/25 network. then i found the 10.2.2.7 which had important hint on it. it also has access to the 10.10.10.129/29 network, 
just succesfully made a reverse tunnel from the 10.2.2.7 back to the .126 using the internal interface and now i have a working dynamic tunnel made so i can use my port scans. from there i found the 10.10.10.140, .167, .182, and the .181. scanning them now
to see what i can find

****password for 10.2.2.7****
"H0ld 73h d00r?"

10.10.10.140 (capstone-08) : 301, 21  --> ssh is running on the port that corresponds with the HTTP status code for Moved permanently. the flag is the port number(301) converted to BASE64, This system also seems to be a pivot for the network reconnaissance section
10.10.10.167 (capstone-10): 404, 80 --> ssh is running on a port that corresponds with the HTTP status code for not found. The flag for this system is the port number converted to BASE64, this system seems to be a pivot for the movement and redirection section
10.10.10.182 (capstone-12): 504, 21 --> ssh is running on the port that corresponds with the http status code for Gateway Timeout. the flag for this system is the port to base64, this sytem seems to be a pivot for the network analysis and filtering sections.
10.10.10.181(?):no ports found 

after ssh'ing to the 10.10.10.140, i found these stations

192.168.10.39(capstone-09): 3790, 21 --> there is a webservice running on the sa,e port that metasploit uses for its webservice
