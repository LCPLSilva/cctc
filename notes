once u ssh onto the pivot u need to create a dynamic tunnel to get ur proxychains on the machine. 
once ur on capstone one with a dynamic tunnel open, run a bash ping sweep like i showed u and figure out all the devices communicating with our float. 
then just run nmap scans through proxychains on the internet host through your dynamic tunnel on each system. thats where i found the info below.

float IP of pivot : 10.50.20.84

10.1.1.30: 80, pivot for network fundamentals and programming sections

10.1.1.33: 21, 23, 80
"RIPv2 seems to be running on the 10.1.1.0/25 network, try to sniff out the traffic to find out what networks its advertising in its updates. what you find will be the IP address of the next environment pivot to access from INTERNET_HOST

10.1.1.11: 21,23

10.1.1.25: 21

10.1.1.90: no ports
10.1.1.125: no ports i thought port 125 was open?
10.1.1.126: no ports

there is a webservice running on the port that corresponds with the RFC that governs Private IPv4 addressing
there is a PCAP saved in the share folder of this machine that you should look at

10.1.1.25: 21
there is a webservice running on the port that corresponds with the RFC that governs IPv4 Header structure
There is another hint in the student home drive, there is no SSh access to this system so try using FTP with your student credentials
