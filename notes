once u ssh onto the pivot u need to create a dynamic tunnel to get ur proxychains on the machine. 
once ur on capstone one with a dynamic tunnel open, run a bash ping sweep like i showed u and figure out all the devices communicating with our float. 
then just run nmap scans through proxychains on the internet host through your dynamic tunnel on each system. thats where i found the info below.
